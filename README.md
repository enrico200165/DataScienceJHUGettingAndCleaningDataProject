# (GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor

Basic useful feature list:

 * Ctrl+S / Cmd+S to save the file
 * Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S to choose to save as Markdown or HTML
 * Drag and drop a file into here to load it
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files


I'm no good at writing sample / filler text, so go write something yourself.

Look, a list!

 * foo
 * bar
 * baz

And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.


Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.

 # Objectives
 To demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set by producing a tidy data set starting from an untidy data set.
The originary data for the untidy data set, descriptions of those data are available at:A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
the data actually used for this task are available at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

# Deliverables
As requested by the assignment the deliverables are:
* <b>a tidy data set</b>
<br />available in file: HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesDataSet_tidy.txt
<br />read it inside R with read.table("HumanActivityRecognitionUsingSmartphonesDataSet_tidy.txt", header = TRUE)
* <b>a link to a Github repository</b> with your script for performing the analysis
<br />https://github.com/enrico200165/DataScienceJHUGettingAndCleaningDataProject
* <b>a code book</b> called <b>CodeBook.md</b>
  <br />that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
* <b>this README.md file</b>
* one <b>R script</b> called <b>run_analysis.R</b>
<br />that does the following.
  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
